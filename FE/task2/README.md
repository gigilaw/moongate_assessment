This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


# Task 2

Create a single page website using `NextJS` that displays a countdown timer.

Requirements:

- Create a reusable component for the countdown timer. The component should take a datetime as a prop and display the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Accept user input to set the datetime to countdown and a `start` button to trigger the countdown.

# Getting Started

```bash
npm run dev
# or

pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
